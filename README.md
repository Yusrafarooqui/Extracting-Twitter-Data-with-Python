A Brief Tutorial on Accessing Twitter Data 

Authors: Yusra Farooqui

This is a git repository to release and share the code from the article: Using Python to retrieve data from Twitter. The is a simple and straightforward repository, used as a means for a starting point for further scientific analysis.
All results contained in the article are generated through running the code contained in this repository.
The code is written in iPython 3.5.2 and should be compatible with other versions. However, Python is backwards incompatible, therefore, if you are using the code in Python 2, you will have to make some adjustments for the code to successfully execute. I highly recommend using Spyder, Anaconda as a starting point. For the most part the script relies only on tweepy, a python tool made to access the Twitter API. The code covers the following topics;
1.	Accessing Twitter API
2.	Twitter Rate Limits
3.	Retrieving tweets from own and user timelines
4.	Live-streaming tweets
5.	Searching tweets with Emojis
